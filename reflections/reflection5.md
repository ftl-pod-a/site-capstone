## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) The pacing was just right!

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over? For the most part our plan for the course development did not change that much. The only thing that we changed was the login, instead of using google login we created our own. Something that we woukd have done differently would have been doing our own login and database since the beginning to not waste time.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered? The labs ans weekly assignments were helpful in preparing us to create the capstone project by showing how from the begginign how to create an app and use the pern stack. I feel the evertything was covered but maybe a lesson on security would be nice for when you create your own password.


* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.) The resrources that were the most helpfuls were the sptin planning, instructors (they really helped when we had questions and needed help with a few bugs), the mentors (guiding us in how to make our application the best application possible), and the demo practice since it made us feel prepared and confident for our final presentation.
