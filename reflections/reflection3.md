## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One successful thing that we did this week was implementing a chatbot and working on polishing our main features and our css.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges that my group and I faced this week were using render since sometimes it would make the website go slow.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we finished all of our tasks in our sprint plan for this week. We were able to polished our MVP and add new features and more css styling. The remaining tasks on our list are to add more css.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, having the Trello board was extremely important because it kept us organized and we were able to divide the tasks and work on the independently but also as a team. We were able to mark all the tasks as completed in the trello board and we were always checking that we were meeting out weekly goals.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 The user story that seems the most "at risk" would be regarding a budget functionality. However, as a way to still think about budget, the price has been added in a new page called SkinHub and Trending and the Routine page too. Next week we plan to keep working on more css.
