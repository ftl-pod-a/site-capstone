## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

The getting the Gemini API to get the ingredients and generate the products. Designing the home page and setting our up our key databases. We only had 1 merge conflict.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We struggled a lot with generating the products after getting the ingredients from the Gemini API but we were able to figure it out in the end.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were able to finish all tasks planned for this sprint. We hope to complete more and add on to our MVP in the next sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, setting up the Trello board really helped us with managing our time and staying track with what needed to be done. It also helped with dividing up task and our communication as a group. Also, the videos provided by the instructors were very helpful as well.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Possibly our last user story regarding a budget. We have not really looked into it yet but we feel confident that we are making good progress and that we will be able to get to it in the upcoming sprints.
