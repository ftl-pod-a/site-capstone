## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One successful thing that we did this week was connecting the backend to the frontend completel (products, routine, comments, likes). The functionality of the website is complete in terms of MVP.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges that my group and I faced this week were making the skinHub page with the likes and the comments and then saving the routine for the user when they log out and log in again. At the end, we were able to make it work and the functionality is implemented.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we finished all of our tasks in our sprint plan for this week. We were able to finished our MVP and next week we plan on implementing stretch features and more css styling to the website as a whole.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, having the Trello board was extremely important because it kept us organized and we were able to divide the tasks and work on the independently but also as a team. The guide to deploy the database, backend, and frontend was also helpful. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 The user story that seems the most "at risk" would be regarding a budget functionality. However, as a way to still think about budget, the price has been added in a new page called SkinHub and they can search products and look at the prices. Next week we plan to keep working to make it even more useful for the user.
